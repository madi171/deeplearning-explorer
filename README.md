# deeplearning-explorer 
This is a private demo project for deeplearning. 
## Platform includes:
* Tensorflow
* Keras
## Domain includes:
* Item2Vec: Implements item embedding given user behavior log
* User2Vec: (not impl. yet)
* CNN-demo-tf: Simple Convolutional Neural Network demo to make classification on MNIST datasets.
* LSTM-ctr-predict: Predicting item click problility given previous reading history on LSTM model
* Deep&Wide-tf: Try Google's new model combine deep and wide model together
* Lots of GAN: GAN, DCGAN, WGAN demo on MNIST
* VGG16: Predicting image score with VGG16 model

> Datasets are stored seperatly on other cloud clusters
